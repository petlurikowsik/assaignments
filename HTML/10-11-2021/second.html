    <h1>INTRODUTION</h1>
    <p>We all have seen computers in our homes, schools or colloges. In fact in today's scenario we find computers in most aspects of daily life, and for some it is hard to even imagine a world without them. A computer is basically a machine that takes instructions and performs computations based on those instructions. </p>
    <h2>WHAT IS A COMPUTER?</h2>
    <P>A computer is an electronic device that takes instructions and performs computations based on those instrutions.</P>
    <h3>HISTORY OF COMPUTERS</h3>
    <p>History of computers can be understood by looking into five generations. With each new generation of computers, there had been advancement in computer technology.</p>
    <ol type ="A">
    <li><h4><b>First generation(1942-1955)</b></h4></li>
    <p><b>Hardware technology</b> First generation computers were manufactured using thousands of vacuum tubes. Vacuum is a device made of fragile glass.</p>
    <li><h5><b>Second generation(1955-1964)</b></h5></li>
    <p><b>Hardware technology</b> second generation computers were manufactured using transistors. Transistors were reliable, powerful, cheaper, smaller, and cooler than vacuum tubes.</p>
    <li><h6><b>Third generation(1964-1975)</b></h6></li>
    <p><b>Hardware technology</b> Third generation computers were manufactured using integrated chips. ICs consists of several components such as transistors, capacitors, and resistors on a single chip to avoid wired interconnection between components.</p>
