        <p>The historic city established by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah on the southern side of the Musi River forms the
            heritage region of Hyderabad called the Purana Shahar (Old City), while the "New City" encompasses the
            urbanised area on the northern banks. The two are connected by many bridges across the river, the oldest of
            which is Purana Pul—("old bridge") built in 1578 AD.[132] Hyderabad is twinned with neighbouring
            Secunderabad, to which it is connected by Hussain Sagar.[133]

            Many historic and heritage sites lie in south central Hyderabad, such as the Charminar, Mecca Masjid, Salar
            Jung Museum, Nizam Museum, Telangana High Court, Falaknuma Palace, Chowmahalla Palace and the traditional
            retail corridor comprising the Pearl Market, Laad Bazaar and Madina Circle..<br><br> North of the river are
            hospitals, colleges, major railway stations and business areas such as Begum Bazaar, Koti, Abids, Sultan
            Bazar and Moazzam Jahi Market, along with administrative and recreational establishments such as the Reserve
            Bank of India, the Telangana Secretariat, the India Government Mint, the Telangana Legislature, the Public
            Gardens, the Nizam Club, the Ravindra Bharathi, the State Museum, the Birla Temple and the Birla
            Planetarium.
            The Charminar (lit. 'four minarets') constructed in 1591, is a monument and mosque located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The landmark has become known globally as a symbol of Hyderabad and is listed among the most recognised structures in India. It has also been officially incorporated as the Emblem of Telangana for the state of Telangana.[3] The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 400 years. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr.[4]

            The Charminar is situated on the east bank of Musi river.[5] To the west lies the Laad Bazaar, and to the southwest lies the richly ornamented granite Makkah Masjid.[6] It is listed as an archaeological and architectural treasure on the official "List of Monuments" prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India.[7] The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu words chār and minar or meenar, translating to "Four Pillars"; the eponymous towers are ornate minarets attached and supported by four grand arches.
